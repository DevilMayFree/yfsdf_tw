					<h2>3.Board diversity policy and implementation</h2>
					<p>Our board diversity policy</br>
					On November 13, 2018, the Board passed a resolution to introduce a Code of Corporate Governance. YFY’s board diversity policy is set out in Chapter 3 (Composition and Powers of the Board), Article 19 of the Code. This includes adopting a candidate nomination system and complying with the company’s Director Election Rules and Code of Corporate Governance to ensure the diversity and independence of board members. None of the directors is a spouse or a relative within two degrees of relationship as required by Item 3 and Item of Article 26-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act.  None of the independent directors, their spouses or relatives within the second degree of relationship are directors, supervisors or employees of the Company, its affiliates or companies with specific relationships with the Company and do not hold shares in the Company; nor have they provided commercial, legal, financial or accounting services to the Company or its affiliates in the last two years.</p>

					<p>The professional backgrounds of the Board includes industry, management and accounting. The members of our 28th Board of Directors who excel in leadership, operational decision-making, business management and crisis management include directors Jean Liu, David Lo, Kirk Hwang, and Chun-Chieh Huang, as well as accountant Chin-San Wang. Our independent directors include Hsi Peng Lu, Yie-Yun Chang, Jin-li Hu are all university professors; and Di-Shi Huang has expertise in criminal investigation.</p>

					<p>Among the members of the Company's Board of Directors, there are two
					directors with employee status. There are 4 independent directors, 1 independent director has served for 6 years and the other three are all elected as independent directors from 2021. In terms of age, there are 2 directors over the age of 70, 2 directors between the ages of 60 and 70, 5 directors between the ages of 50 and 60.The Company also emphasizes gender equality in the composition of the Board of Directors. The current term of the Board of Directors includes two female members (one of whom is an independent director).</p>

					<h2>7. Succession Planning for Board Members</h2>
					<p>Company's board of directors is appointed through shareholder director nominations at the shareholders' meeting. In alignment with Corporate Governance 3.0 Sustainable Development Road Map, which aims to enhance the independence of independent directors in listed companies, we promote that independent directors on the boards of listed companies should not serve more than three consecutive terms, ensuring a generational turnover in director and independent director selections. To maintain continuity and stability in the operation of the board between successive terms, the proportion of board member turnover should not be excessively high during each election cycle. This approach allows for the transfer of the management and governance experience of the previous board to the subsequent one. To further enhance the capabilities of our directors, our company offers regular educational opportunities in addition to their existing professional expertise. We provide various courses covering topics related to financial, business, legal, accounting, ESG, and internal control systems relevant to corporate governance. Each director is required to complete a minimum of six hours of continuing education annually to ensure they possess excellent corporate governance skills. Furthermore, in addition to nurturing potential director successors from within our group and senior management ranks, we simultaneously search for professional candidates with backgrounds in business, law, finance, accounting, or corporate affairs, who can serve as directors or independent directors, contributing to our succession planning in the future.</p>
